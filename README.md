# The Millionaire | Text Adventure Game Development

My name is Jorge Hernández Jiménez and this is my first project working with Python (10/12/2019). I have never
coded before. After two weeks since I started to study Python at Hult International Business School
in San Francisco, I have created a text adventure game based on the TV Show: Who Want to be a Millionaire?
During the game, the player have to answer three different questions that are selected randomly from a list
of five questions. Every time the player get an asnwer write he/she can decide if continue with the game
and put in risk all its money or finish the game and get the money he/she just won.

I would have like to put some audios like the sound of the roulette spinning. I got a code to can do it in a 
different cell but I could not define it and insert in this code. The code I used was:

from IPython.display import Audio, Image, YouTubeVideo
roulette_spin = 'sounds/roulette.mp3'
Audio(data = roulette_spin, autoplay = True)
